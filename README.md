# ML Project

Here I will introduce ML projects I have been working on.

It consists of a few exercises made during [NeuralNine Python ML course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg5paDArl3E&list=PL7yh-TELLS1EZGz1-VDltwdwZvPV-jliQ&index=2&ab_channel=NeuralNine).

# I familirized myself with:
- Linear Regression,
- K-Nearest Neighbors Classification,
- Support Vector Machines,
- Decision Trees and Random Forest,
- K-Means Clustering,
- Neural Networks.

# Projects

**[Project 1](KNN_classifying_plants.py)**

Predicting flower species from the Iris dataset using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). It splits and standardizes the data, trains a KNN model, evaluates accuracy with a confusion matrix and classification report, and uses GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters for improved performance.

**[Project 2](tf_identifying_handwritten_digits)**

This code trains a digit classification model on the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow. It normalizes the data, defines a neural network with three dense layers, compiles and trains the model for three epochs, evaluates its accuracy on the test set, and predicts digits from custom images.
